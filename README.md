SPEC:

* - input string
  - output said string
  - if the string the user inputs matches the one the object contains, we can begin the work

* - input searchitemstring
  - output the same string
  - if the string the object has is the same as the searchitemstring the user inputs, we can accurately search our previous string

* - input 2 matching strings
  - output they match
  - this is the first test of the code, matching 2 same strings

* - input 2 nonmatching strings
  - output they dont matching
  - checking for consistency so we dont get errors down the line

* - input a sentence string and a word string, the sentence containing said word
  - output there is 1 match
  - testing our code to see if we can count matching strings within a sentence

* - input a sentence string and word string, with multiple occurrences of said word in said string
  - output # of matches
  - final test of our code, counting ever instance of matched string
